**Project overview:** 
An ideal churn rate is 5-7% per year, depending on if you measure customers or revenue. The churn rate in this project was calculated overall, for a period of 72 months (3 years) based on the data set fields: customer segments, service types, monthly charges, payment methods, tech support, streaming services and contract type.

In the period of three years, churn rate was 26.54%, with with a 1.8% per year churn rate increase above an ideal 7% upper band churn rate.

**Problem statement:** 
The business stakeholder requires succinct and clear insights to reasons behind churn, and actionable decisions that could improve customer retention in the future.

**Actionable takeaways:** 
* Reduce early churn by improving onboarding & initial support.
* Target high-churn customers (0-6 months) with retention offers or discounts.
* Analyze pricing strategies—high charges might drive early exits.
* Loyal customers (tenure >60 months) bring the most revenue—reward them!
